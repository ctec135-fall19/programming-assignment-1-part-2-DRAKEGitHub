Module 2, Programming Assignment 1 Part 2: 2 Coding Projects, Problem 3

Create a New Project called Prob3
Create a program that prints out actions based upon decision table.
Create methods for each action that contains print statement with text in Ouput
Methods are same level as Main()
Region 1 inside Main() is 3 nested loops to execute conditions
print a line in the innermost loop stating the conditions
Use if statements to call methods and print possible actions
Region 2 Inside Main() Use binary table method in a single for loop for 0 to 7
use a switch statement in the body with iteration variable as its value
code in each case will call the appropriate methods based on number
